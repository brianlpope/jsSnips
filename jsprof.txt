Javascript tests for potential candidates

1. What core types are available in JavaScript. /* number, string, boolean, null, undefined.  
                                                   Also consider object and function */

2. Show the contents of `bar` without referring to it directly. /* window[foo] */

```
var foo = 'bar';
var bar = 'show me';
```

3.  What is the output at the referenced points? 

```
var Test = function() { this.one = 'a'; };

Test.prototype.two = 'b';

var a = new Test();

console.log(a.one); // what does this log? /* a */
console.log(a.two); // what does this log? /* b */

Test.prototype = {
	two: 'c'
};

var b = new Test();

console.log(a.two); // what does this log? /* b, because the prototype object is overwritten after 'b' has been assigned
                                              to the prototype of the Test object.  a.two would be the value of the 
                                              prototype at the time the a instance was created or any updates to the 
                                              prototype reference before the prototype object was overwritten, as it was
                                              done when two was set to 'c'. */
console.log(b.two); // what does this log? /* c */
```

4.  What is the result of the following? /* returns 9 since the first call is passed a 3 and returns a function 
                                            where x=3, y=1, and z=2.  The second call executes the returned function 
                                            where a closure keeps x=3 and z=2 and y is passed in as 4.  So 3+4+2=9. */

```
(function(x) {
	var y = 1,
		z = 2;
	return function(y) {
		return x + y + z;
	};
})(3)(4);
```

5.  What is the output at the referenced points? 

```
var Test = function() { this.one = 'a'; };

Test.prototype.two = 'b';

var a = new Test();

console.log(a.hasOwnProperty('one')); // what does this log? /* true */
console.log(a.hasOwnProperty('two')); // what does this log? /* false */
```

6.  What is the difference between the two blocks? /* x is a global variable in block 1 and a local variable 
                                                      in block 2 */

```
var run = function() {
	x = 5;
};
run();
```

```
var run = function() {
	var x = 5;
};
run();
```

7.  /(bb|[^b]{2})/  /* 2b or not 2b, very funny */
